I am creating a web api where people can join and chat with each other
for this we will need to use socket.io (cause we have to continuously fetch and transfer
data to server and from server here socket io will help us to do this with low latancy)
i have stored all frontend files in client-side folder and i will store all backend files 
like server.js package.json node_modules in server-side folder

**let's understand below code
"
io.on('connection', (socket)=>{
    console.log('connection established', socket.id);

    socket.on('disconnect', ()=>{
        console.log(`${socket.id} left the chat`);
    })
})
"

everytime when someone is joining will trigger io and will get one unique socket.id
then 'connection established and socket.id' will get logged in console
and after socket/person closes the tag 'socket.id left the chat' will get logged.


`in simple language io is server and sockets are sitting on the clients`
if io emmit anything all socket can listen but if socket emmit anything only io can listen
